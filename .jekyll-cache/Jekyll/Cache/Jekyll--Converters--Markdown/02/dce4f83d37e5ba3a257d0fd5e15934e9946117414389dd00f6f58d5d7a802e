I"Ä<p>While listening to an older episode of Bulletproof Radio podcast with Steven Fowkes recently, and I got the undeniable feeling that Steven was against drinking coffee but didnâ€™t really want to say so on the podcast episode.</p>

<p>Being the inquisitive guy I am I decided to email him after I finished the episode and ask him his thoughts about coffee.</p>

<p>It turns out it wasnâ€™t so much the Coffee that he was against, but rather Caffeine consumption itself.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t seen an explanation as succinct and useful as the one Steven wrote me, and you can trust that his references are well-founded. Here it is below:</p>

<p><em>Anthonyâ€”</em></p>

<p><em>Many people have problems with caffeine.</em></p>

<p><em>1. Itâ€™s an adrenal stimulant, which masks hypothyroidism. So risks of adrenal exhaustion increase with regular use.</em></p>

<p><em>2. It has strong pH effects, acidifying for 2 hours, alkalinizing for the next 8 hours. People with alkaline pH imbalances can get addicted, and it gets worse over time.</em></p>

<p><em>3. Caffeine interferes with sleep architecture and DNA repair. Even one cup a day.</em></p>

<p><em>4. Caffeine alters brain wave patterns and can affect behavior. Good and bad.</em></p>

<p><em>5. Coffee is a source of mycotoxins and carcinogens (and anti-carcinogens).</em></p>

<p><em>The bottom line is that caffeine is an insecticide, produced by plants to kill insect predators.Â  In humans, it is merely a mild nerve irritant.Â  For me, it is items 1, 3 and 2 in that order.</em></p>

<p>So is the answer Decaf? Not sure about that one yet. Decaf coffee requires a highly mechanical process to remove the caffeine, which degrades the nutrient value of the final product.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really thankful that Steven got back to me so quickly on this one with such great info. You can check out his website at <a href="http://www.projectwellbeing.com/">ProjectWellbeing.com</a> for more health-related posts from him.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? While Iâ€™ve always enjoyed a nice cup of coffee, recently Iâ€™ve switched to <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2mwA6nj">Pu-erh tea</a></strong> which is much less stimulating.</p>
