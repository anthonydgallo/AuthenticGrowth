I"R<p><em><strong>“All true tea lovers not only like their tea strong, but like it a little stronger with each year that passes.” – George Orwell</strong></em></p>

<p>I used to love a good cup of coffee. I didn’t think much of coffee when I was younger - but when I entered the work force it was taken for granted that everyone expected to have at least one cup of coffee while they went about their day. I quickly joined that force as I found coffee helped me wake up in the mornings and focus more on my work. One cup in the morning quickly turned into another afternoon cup, and sometimes a third for good measure. I didn’t see anything wrong with this - until, that is, I started having some pretty severe stomach acid problems.</p>

<p>Now this was something that came as a total surprise to me. Everything I had read suggested coffee has numerous health benefits, which it does, but nothing I had read really stuck out the fact that coffee is a highly acidic drink that can cause problems on it’s own. All of the coffee I was drinking started to influence stomach acid production in my body - slowly eating at my digestive lining. I needed to kick the habit but I was so used to drinking a few cups a day that I was determined to find an alternative route.</p>

<p>Right around this time, I had finished listening to an episode of the Tim Ferriss Show podcast where he mentioned a new blend of Pu-erh tea he was testing with a few other ingredients. I had heard people mention Pu-erh a few times but I thought - “Tea? Meh there’s a million teas, that one probably is just like all the others.” I’ll admit I had wanted to try something new though, so I went and bought some <a href="http://amzn.to/2rFC0VU">Pu-erh Tea</a> from my local 99 Ranch market. My first reaction was that this stuff was pretty good. My second reaction was - I think I’ve found what I need to kick the habit.</p>

<h3 id="think-of-yourself-as-a-non-coffee-drinker"><strong>Think Of Yourself As A Non-Coffee Drinker</strong></h3>

<p>The first step to kicking the coffee habit, if you want to do it entirely, is to consider yourself a non-coffee drinker from the start. Many self-development books reference the idea that “100% is easy, 99% is tough.” By this they mean that if you commit to changing a habit 100% of the time, instead of “just sometimes”, you are way more likely to succeed. That’s what this tip is about here - just wake up on day one and say “I’m a non-coffee drinker” and start your trials in the pu-erh tea arena. You’ll of course want to get extra rest the night before - caffeine withdrawal is a very real thing, but that isn’t to say that you can’t supplement with a little bit of <a href="http://amzn.to/2r6X0rw">green tea</a> to help.</p>

<p>You read that heading correctly. There are numerous studies on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641056">nlm.nih.gov</a> touting the benefits of <a href="http://amzn.to/2rFC0VU">Pu-erh Tea</a> for improving several key ailments that affect many people in the Western world. I personally drink a cup of Pu-erh in the morning and usually after lunch if I am in the office. I find that after a meal, Pu-erh Tea really helps me stay awake and though this is anecdotal I can definitely attest improved digestion aspects of these studies. I feel that Pu-erh helps prevent blood sugar spikes if I drink it shortly after eating a meal at my desk. I’m not a doctor of course and can’t say whether you will feel the same, but I can say that drinking Pu-erh tea is worth a shot based on the research available. I’ve personally convinced 3 other colleagues to buy a box and they love it.</p>

<p>Pu-erh tea has officially helped me kick coffee for the last 4 months. With the concept that I am a “non-coffee drinker” in mind, I have thoroughly corrected my stomach acid issues and probably saved quite a bit of money by not having anything to buy when I pass a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. It’s amazing that you can go from 2 or 3 cups every single day to 0 cups a week and still function at the same or an even higher level. That’s what I’ve discovered since I stopped drinking coffee and started drinking <a href="http://amzn.to/2rFC0VU">Pu-erh Tea</a>, and I know you too can discover it for yourself.</p>
