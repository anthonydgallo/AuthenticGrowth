I"π<p>Since the dawn of Smartphone civilization, everyone has thought that multi-tasking is the ultimate goal, the <em>ultimate</em> skill!</p>

<p>Well I‚Äôm here to tell you that something has seriously been lost with us trying to multi-task every activity of our life, and I‚Äôm not alone in this sentiment.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743226755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743226755&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=QUHBKHJHQFT3NPEE"><strong><em>The Power of Full Engagement</em></strong></a> recently and it really got me thinking about the idea and value of being fully engaged in any given activity.</p>

<p>How many things can you do at once? I think I can do many things, maybe 10-15 solid things at one time. But here‚Äôs the <strong>real</strong> question- How many things are you ACTUALLY doing?</p>

<p>[caption id=‚Äùattachment_490‚Äù align=‚Äùaligncenter‚Äù width=‚Äù618‚Äù]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC"><img src="http://www.authenticgrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Long_Distance_Running.jpg" alt="Run baby, Run" /></a> Run baby, Run[/caption]</p>

<p>I made a startling discovery and I‚Äôd like to teach all of you the clear distinction that allowed me to improve my workouts, increase my peace, improve my<!-- more --> personal presence, and learn a whole lot more in the process.</p>

<p>The idea was simple, yet powerful. Instead of bringing my smartphone with me to the gym, running, or even meditating, I replaced it with the latest version of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC">iPod Shuffle</a></strong>.</p>

<p>That wasn‚Äôt the only step though, I also loaded the iPod Shuffle with a variety of¬†<em>educational content</em>, such as podcasts, audiobooks, and one long meditation track for meditating, and nothing else.</p>

<p>What? I bought an¬†<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC">iPod Shuffle</a></strong> so that I can do something my PHONE can already do? And filled it with education stuff?? How did that change your life Anthony?</p>

<p>Yes, I figured you‚Äôd ask about that. Well, buying this iPod Shuffle has changed everything when it comes to how I workout, my meditation sessions, and yes even my walks or runs around town.</p>

<p>Before, knowing that my phone was in my pocket, I would always check it at the gym. Despite multiple attempts to limit this activity, we always <em>feel</em> that there is something waiting for us, right there on our phones in our pocket and I‚Äôd inevitably end up checking it.</p>

<p>Since I switched to using my iPod Shuffle at the gym and leaving my phone at home, I no longer have the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù of feeding the urge to check my notifications, text, email, or anything.</p>

<p>[caption id=‚Äùattachment_508‚Äù align=‚Äùaligncenter‚Äù width=‚Äù613‚Äù]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC"><img src="http://www.authenticgrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/peace.jpg" alt="peace" /></a> This is what I feel like when I leave my phone at home[/caption]</p>

<p>By doing this, I have <em>forced</em> myself to workout and do nothing else. I can‚Äôt check if you text me, babe! I can‚Äôt check if I got an email about the latest information product I should buy! Now its just me and the weights, or me and nature as I do my early morning runs.</p>

<p>The reason I filled it up with only educational material, which I usually listen to on my phone anyway, is so that I can conveniently focus this device as a personal development device, which I know happily dub my ‚ÄúKnowledgePod‚Äù. I have everything audio-related that I want to focus on, all in one space, and I update my iTunes playlists daily, adding and removing material as I go through it.</p>

<p>Now, whenever I go to the gym, or whenever I go for a walk or meditate, <strong>I‚Äôm not allowing the outside world to distract me</strong> from my exercise goals, nor am I allowing the world to follow me as I go on my contemplating walks or runs.</p>

<p>I am incredibly happy with this separation of tasks, and I think the less I bring my phone places, the more I allow my mind to do what it does best, which is <strong><em>coming up with great ideas</em></strong>.</p>
