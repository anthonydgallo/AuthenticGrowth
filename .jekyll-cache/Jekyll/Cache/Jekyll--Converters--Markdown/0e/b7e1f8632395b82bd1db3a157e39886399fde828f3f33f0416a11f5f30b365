I"¿<p><strong>Today‚Äôs post is about a key ingredient in everyone‚Äôs daily growth and success‚Ä¶</strong></p>

<p>There are certain base concepts that make up the whole of many of the teachings in personal growth and development.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, sometimes the simplest things are the most powerful. Why is this?</p>

<p><strong>Because the simpler things appear, the more often they are overlooked.</strong></p>

<p>What you focus on, your life revolves around.</p>

<p><strong>What you focus on, you become.</strong></p>

<p>Knowing that your thoughts literally create your reality (we live mostly in our minds) then:</p>

<p><strong>How important is it that we consciously choose what we focus on?</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôll tell you- its probably the most important, fundamental thing you‚Äôll ever learn.</p>

<p>If you choose to focus on thoughts of fear, worries, and doubts- your life will be miserable.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not here to say that occasionally having those thoughts is terrible, but I am here to say that when we do have these thoughts- we have to choose something better. We need to take our focus and use it like a laser. <strong>Point it at the things that you desire, focus on what you want</strong>.</p>

<p>The most ¬†important thing you need to know to live a happy life- is to focus on what you want.</p>

<p><strong>To live a happy, fulfilling life.. We have to choose to have thoughts that make our lives better.</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve caught myself, several times in the past week, focusing on things that I didn‚Äôt want. And what happens when I do this? I create a world, albeit temporarily, where these thoughts run my life. I create a world where I am surrounded by images, worries, and doubts that I do not want. Who wants that? No one does. Yet we all allow ourselves to brood on doubts and fears.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll ask you, following this post, to do one thing for me tomorrow:</p>

<p><strong>When you catch yourself focusing on what you do not want, shift your focus onto something that you do want</strong>.</p>

<p>Realize that this world, the reality that you see around you, is basically a projection of your internal mind. All of the meaning that anything holds comes from your beliefs about these items, circumstances, and things. Choose to live in a reality that is as much of your conscious choice as possible. Sure, some things may be difficult to change- your environment for one thing. But begin to allow yourself to see things as they are outside of your environment.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on what you want, and you may notice that things in your environment begin to shift</strong>.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice things that you may have never noticed before, all because previously you had your focus on a different area of life.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve made it a trigger now, and I continue to deepen this trigger, that when I find myself focusing on what I don‚Äôt want‚Ä¶</p>

<p>** I literally say out loud ‚ÄúFocus on what you want!‚Äù**</p>

<p>Alright, maybe it‚Äôll be a little under my breath, but I still do it. What‚Äôs the cost of a happier life to you? Is it worth creating small success habits that bring you joy and success over time?</p>

<p>Think about what you are focusing on in life, and notice how shifting your focus can make all the difference. I‚Äôll say it again, as its worth repeating:</p>

<p>What you focus on, you become.<strong>¬†What do you want to be?</strong></p>
