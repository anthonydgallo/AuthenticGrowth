I"’<p><strong>This is an experiment in authenticityâ€¦ what will you become?</strong></p>

<p>What if we lived this way? As if our thoughts were not private?</p>

<p>What kind of person would you be? Is it the type of person you think yourself to be?</p>

<p><strong>The person you become by living your life as if your thoughts are not private is the person you really are.</strong></p>

<p>After we adapt to the idea that our thoughts are not private for this experiment, I suspect a few things will begin to happen.</p>

<p>We will be forced to recognize the errors of our thinking. The negative thoughts that we allow to infiltrate our minds will become more apparent.</p>

<p>How quickly would you change your thinking if everyone around you could hear and feelÂ what was in your mind?</p>

<p>Would you allow yourself to self-loathe or to call yourself names? How about hating or projecting negative ideas about other people?</p>

<p><strong>If you takeÂ conscious control of your thoughts by living as if they were not private, how much better would your inner world become?</strong></p>

<p>How much more control would you have overÂ your life?</p>

<p>This is an experiment in Authentic Living.</p>

<p>Do you have the willpower and personal capacity to tryÂ this out?</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment: Live life with this as a standard, as if your thoughts were not private, for 10 days. Watch what happens.</strong></p>

<p>If you make it 10 days, try 15 days. If you make it 15 days, then try 30 days.</p>

<p>If you can grow accustomedÂ to living this way, and you see the benefits of this experiment coming forth in your mental landscape..</p>

<p>Why not attempt to live the rest of your life this way?</p>

<p>**Some benefits I have experienced:
**</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You realize just how negative and destructive your own thoughts are</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You learn to consciously control the flow of thoughts flying in and out of your mind</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You start living more authentically, expressing and feeling only the things you want yourself to feel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Youâ€™re forced to clean up your act</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You canâ€™t hide or live with â€˜cognitive dissonanceâ€™ anymore</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You realize just how much you project onto other people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You realize who you really are and adjust to live from a better place in life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the shifts Iâ€™ve experienced, there are many more subtle feelings in addition to these.</p>

<p>Now this is a test, an experiment that could improve your life even if tried for only a few days.Â Will you partake it in?</p>
