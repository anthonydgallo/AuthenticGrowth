I"Ú<p>So whatâ€™s all this â€œbullet-proof coffeeâ€ talk youâ€™re hearing about and reading in magazines these days.</p>

<p>The craze is this: It tastes great, its good for you, and it leaves you with in amazing state of mental clarity, focus, and energy that lasts all morning</p>

<p><strong>The basic recipe is below, this is the configuration I currently use:</strong></p>

<p>-OneÂ <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000DLB2FI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=HVHLZOO34NG6RCJB">My K-cup</a></strong> full of <a href="http://amzn.to/1CzuVa3"><strong>Upgraded Coffee beans</strong></a>, brewed twice in a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004978NKY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004978NKY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=BNTEWLB5MK2O6XBH">Keurig</a></strong> at small cup size<strong>:</strong></p>

<p>-One Tablespoon of <strong><a href="http://kerrygoldusa.com/where-to-buy/">Kerrygold Unsalted Grassfed Butter</a></strong>:</p>

<p>-One Tablespoon either <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C">Now Foodâ€™s MCT Oil</a></strong> or Dave Aspreyâ€™s[** Upgraded Brain Octane Oil<strong>](http://amzn.to/18vhxbP) (Caprylic Acid)</strong>:**</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upgradedself.com/products/bulletproof-upgraded-brain-octane-oil"><img src="http://images.iherb.com/l/NOW-02199-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Put this all in a blender for 30 seconds and pour it out.</strong> Take a sip and feel amazing. It sounds weird, but it tastes great. The butter is almost like a nice cream, and the MCT Oil adds a consistency to it that makes the coffee feel almost like a latte. Make sure you donâ€™t put it in a styrofoam cup (oil interacts with styrofoam), and besides that youâ€™ll be good.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, I often add two tablespoons of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG7EDU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005KG7EDU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=AZEW6566THEXTZMR">Great Lakeâ€™s Hydrolasized Collagen Protein</a></strong> to the coffee<strong>:</strong></p>

<p>I have to give Dave Asprey credit here for starting a movement here. Bullet-proof coffee is an awesome way to start your day and it has definitely had an impact on my mornings over the last several months. Iâ€™ve been following his Bulletproof Radio Podcast for almost a year now,Â listeningÂ to every episode heâ€™s put out. He has done a lot to educate people about the benefits of high fat diets and the importance of grassfed foods. While I believe that Daveâ€™s margins are quite high on his products, I do feel that the information Iâ€™ve learned from his podcast warranted a few purchases from his upgraded self store. I havenâ€™t been able to find a good source of liquid Caprylic Acid (Brain Octane Oil) besides Daveâ€™s, so I often do purchase that from him as well as the Upgraded Beans, but I also find <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C">Now Foodâ€™s MCT Oil</a></strong>Â to work just fine and it is half the cost.</p>

<p>I challenge everyone reading this to go out, grab some grassfed butter from Wholefoods or Trader Joeâ€™s, grab someÂ <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C">MCT Oil</a></strong>Â here, and use whatever coffee beans you have or splurge on the Upgrade Self beans.</p>

<p>Just try it, I really believe you will like the results.</p>
