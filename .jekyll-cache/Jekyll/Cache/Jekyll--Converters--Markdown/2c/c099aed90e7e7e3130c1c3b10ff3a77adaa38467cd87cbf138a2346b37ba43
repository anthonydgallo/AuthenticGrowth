I"í<p>Over the years Iâ€™ve tried a lot of different supplements.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a bio-hacker at heart and Iâ€™ve grown through seeing and becoming aware of how vitamins and nutrients affect my mind.</p>

<p><strong>**Enter Magic Mind</strong>**</p>

<p>For the first time since trying out a nootropic mix called Tian Chi a while back, Iâ€™ve found another product that has been doing wonders for me recently.</p>

<p>This bottled nootropic is called <a href="magicmind.co">Magic Mind</a> and after almost 30 days of use Iâ€™m loving it.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s got a lot in the mix, but the main components are Reishi and Lionâ€™s Mane Mushroom complexes. Magic Mind also contains Ashwaganda and Citicholine amongst a few other ingredients.</p>

<p>The base itself is Matcha mixed with honey so it has a very herbal taste to it, but one Iâ€™ve grown fond of drinking each morning.</p>

<p>The feeling it gives me is hard to describe.</p>

<p>There is a pleasant thoughtfulness that sets in at around 30 to 45 minutes after drinking it. Thoughts start popping into my head that I can tell otherwise may have slipped away.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had a lot of productive moments after taking Magic Mind. Solving problems that are usually complex, automating things, and finding myself more curious to research ideas I would normally write down and never get to.</p>

<p>Is it placeabo, you might ask?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried a lot of supplements and have an instinct now for when they work and when they donâ€™t. Magic Mind works.</p>

<p>There is no referall or affiliate link for Magic Mind. Iâ€™m writing this just to put it out there in the ether because Iâ€™ve found it has made working from home during quarantine more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Do with this post what you will.</p>
