I"|<p>I heard it stated so clearly once: <em>“Beliefs are instructions for your mind to bring more of that into your life”</em></p>

<p><strong>What you believe you believe for a reason, but what you don’t know is that your mind likes to convert a lot of your everyday experiences so that they <em>appear</em> to conform to the things you believe.</strong></p>

<p>That may have been a mouthful but if you want to experience change in your life, stay with me for a minute.</p>

<p>Many of your beliefs were not even consciously chosen by you, they were passed down to you by your parents, your early childhood friends, or your teachers in school.</p>

<p><strong>Have you ever taken the time to re-evaluate what you believe about certain things?</strong></p>

<p>This week, I experienced a massive shift when I started evaluating my beliefs around work and money.</p>

<p>I’ve heard about doing belief analysis before but I always glossed over it thinking “I already know what I believe, no use going into it”</p>

<p>This is So tricky, because as Stephen Pressfield might say in <em>The War of Art</em>, that one statement is actually the resistance speaking in disguise. It fooled me for so long, having me thing and believe that I shouldn’t have to analyze my beliefs because of course I know myself.</p>

<p>Once I did a few exercises, I realized I was holding onto beliefs that were COMPLETELY outdated and so old that I don’t even remember how I acquired some of them.</p>

<p>I am actually pretty excited to get more into examining my beliefs ones I’m done studying for a few exams, but I wanted to pop on here to let you all know what I’ve been thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Once you start to consciously become aware of how beliefs shape your reality, you can start to choose which ones you want to hold on to and which ones you want to replace.</strong></p>

<p>This is literally life-changing work here.</p>

<p>When you have the time, now, take a piece of paper out and start doing sentence completion exercises to figure out what you actually believe. To do this, write out things like “I believe that I am….” “I believe that money is….” “I believe that to be happy I have to ….” and write out as many sentence completion lines as you can for each of those sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Usually the first response that your brain gives you is what you actually believe, because given a certain situation your brain will act automatically and that is the response it will have in the moment.</strong></p>

<p>I filled out a few of these sentence completions but am really excited to do more going forward. I discovered a lot of things about myself that I thought I already knew. Somehow all of these things alluded me and now I’m really figuring out how to grow.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best in your belief analysis. I know that this is just the beginning for me but doing this along with my awareness-increasing meditation practice has really been eye-opening.</p>
