I"f<p><strong><em>“Be not afraid of growing slowly. Be only afraid of standing still” - Chinese Proverb</em></strong></p>

<p>This is one practice that differentiates me from many of my peers. One belief, one characteristic that has allowed me to experience tremendous growth in my life. This concept and practice is t_he willingness to change_.</p>

<p><strong>If you have the desire to grow, an openness to change, and the ability to accept new experiences into your life, then the things you need to develop yourself will slowly fall into your lap.</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing that can stop me from seeking out the ideas, concepts, beliefs, practices, and activities that will help me reach my goals. I have an open mind, which was brought about much through my experience in personal growth and trying new ideas out for size. When I first got involved in the personal development scene many years ago, I wasn’t always so open to new concepts. Let’s face it, theres a lot of crazy ideas floating around in this community, and you may be safer not accepting some of them. But my willingness to grow, and to change, and my commitment to understanding and accepting new ideas has made all the difference in my own personal growth.</p>

<p><strong>The willingness to change allows us to see new things that often go ignored. We begin to accept ideas that help us to grow in ways that most others would pass by, simply because these ideas aren’t conventionally accepted.</strong></p>

<p>Personal Growth and Development wasn’t always the big arena that it is today. It has grown this way because of peoples’ willingness to try new things and to look at the world from a different perspective. The willingnes to change, grow, and allow new beliefs into our lives allows us to break our old patterns and see things with a fresh light. If you want to change, the simplest way to do that is to stop doing the things you used to do before. You are the sum total of all your thoughts and actions up until this point. If you aren’t happy with where you are right now, or wish to experience a more positive future, the first step is to expand your willingness to change.

<p><strong>The degree to which we will experience positive, powerful growth in our lives is directly proportional to the degree to which we allow ourselves to open up to new ideas.</strong></p>

<p>If you want change in your life, the fastest way to get it is to seek the advise of other people. It can be difficult to see things objectively when we’re used to doing the same old routine day in and day out. Getting a coach or a mentor, or following websites like this blog, allow you to soak in new ideas that you may never have thought of before. I wouldn’t be anywhere near where I am today without all of the books and programs I’ve allowed myself to soak in. If I had to do it all on my own, I’d be going at a snails pace and the growth I’d have experienced would have come at a much slower rate. Take it upon yourself to enjoy and relish in how valuable a great book can be. Someone spent several years of their life writing a great book for you, and you get to enjoy it and soak it in without having to learn it all yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Reading literally saves you years of time spent learning things the hard way. I think of books as condensed ideas, breakthroughs, and life lessons on paper.</strong></p>

<p>With the willingness to change comes the willingness to explore new life lessons and ideas. Maybe your belief system will change. Maybe you will find some adjustments in your attitude necessary to make the changes that you want to make in your life. This is all good, in fact this is all great. What you need to do is allow all of this change into your life. Your brain, your mind, and your body will work with you and display to you all of the powerful things that exist outside of yourself. Right now, we are blinded to the things that we don’t allow ourselves to see. We are literally surrounded with opportunity, all it takes is the right mindset and the right set of eyes to see it. Now, by right set of eyes, I mean the right set of perception. Your perception is your lens to the world, and with it working properly you will find what you are looking for.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing new ideas to trickle into your mind can help you have epiphanies much faster than letting life teach you all your lessons yourself. Cultivate an attitude of life-long learning and you cultivate a wonderful life.</strong></p>

<p>When you’re reading several books a week (or even one a week, or one a month), you begin to get ideas from all sorts of angles. I consider this a competitive advantage in life, work, and relationships simply because I am able to pull concepts from all different areas and apply them to the task that I am focusing on. If I have spent 1000 more hours reading that another person, chances are those 1000 hours will provide me some insight that (perhaps) the other person wouldn’t have. There’s always a balance, as that fellow could have been practicing something equally valuable to him, but I would stand firm is saying that reading good material is an invaluable activity.</p>

<p><strong>Open up your mind and accept the fact that you don’t know everything. You are not a robot. The world is an infinite place and you are just beginning to understand your reason for being here.</strong></p>

<p>Being willing to change and grow will allow you to further expand on other’s ideas. Being open to having your beliefs inspected can result in incredibly powerful shifts in perspective. If you can begin to release your grip on your world, and let new ideas permeate your mind, you may find that your growth speeds up as well. You are no longer in this alone as other people are more than willing to help you see things differently. Change the lens of your perspective, by bathing in new concepts and ideas. I for one know that my life philosophy will always be expanding. The greatest people to ever live have always been exploring their own philosophies, so isn’t it time you expand on yours?</p>
