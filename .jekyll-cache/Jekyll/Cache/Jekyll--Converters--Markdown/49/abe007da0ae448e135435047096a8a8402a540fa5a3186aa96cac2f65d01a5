I"C<p>This month I finished reading quite a few great books, but today I want to share a story that really clicked with me from the bookÂ <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1CIw9Ar">Awareness by Anthony De Mello</a></strong>. This is a story about coming to terms with the nature of reality, and it packs a powerful message.</p>
