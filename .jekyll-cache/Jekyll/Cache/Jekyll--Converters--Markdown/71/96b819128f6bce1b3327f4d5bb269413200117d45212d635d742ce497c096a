I"˜<p><em><strong>To make it into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.‚Äù</strong></em>** -<strong>**Proust on reading</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôm writing this post today - speaking from the perspective of a person who on average reads 100 books a year.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had a realization this week that all of this book reading may actually be preventing me from seeing who I really am.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, reading quality books has got to be one of the healthiest addictions that any person can have, but stay with me here for a second.</p>

<p>What happens when you constantly have your head in a book is that your mind is swimming in other peoples thoughts. This may not be a bad thing for growth, its always great to be inspired by other people. I‚Äôm starting to question now, though, when is it that we take a break from swimming in thoughts of others and start to list to our own voice?</p>

<p>With me, I‚Äôm always reading 2-3 different books simultaneously during any given week, and all of these ideas are floating around in my head as I progress through each day of my life.</p>

<p>But where, now, are my own thoughts? With all of these thoughts from other people floating around in my mind, which ones are actually mine?</p>

<p><strong>Here is where my challenge for you and for myself comes: The 7-Day Book Fast. That‚Äôs right: No books for one week.</strong></p>

<p>This may sound absolutely simple for non-book readers. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI can do that seeing as I don‚Äôt read anyway‚Äù.</p>

<p>Well I‚Äôve got a challenge for you folks as well. <strong>For Non book readers: Stop watching TV, listening to the news, or reading shared Facebook posts</strong>.</p>

<p>The goal of this challenge here is for you to give your mind a chance to speak its own thoughts. To give your mind time to consume the vast amounts of ideas that you‚Äôve given it, and to adjust them into your own personality.</p>

<p>Can you handle being with your own thoughts?</p>
