I"”<p>Quick Note: This is a short post, and though it is thought provoking! Be prepared for some mild, even depressing, self-introspection.</p>

<p><strong>Now Imagine this:Â </strong>Youâ€™re 90 years old, in a hospital bed, looking out into the world.</p>

<p>You know your time has come, and you canâ€™t help but wish you had just one more day to live on this earth.</p>

<p><strong>How much would you pay for that one more day?</strong></p>

<p>Think about it, <em>actually</em> <em>come up with</em> a number.</p>

<p>Now, for the next important question.</p>

<p><strong>If you would pay that much for one more day, why are you spending your day the way you are now?</strong></p>

<p>â€œNowâ€ as in this week, last week, yesterday. Whether it was laying in bed, worrying about things, doing things you donâ€™t love.</p>

<p><strong>Every day is worth just as much as what you would pay for that one extra day at the end of your life</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowing this, what haveÂ youâ€™ve been putting off doing?</p>

<p><strong>I ask myself these questions every month or two, to see where my heads at. It may benefit AuthenticGrowth readers to do the same.</strong></p>
