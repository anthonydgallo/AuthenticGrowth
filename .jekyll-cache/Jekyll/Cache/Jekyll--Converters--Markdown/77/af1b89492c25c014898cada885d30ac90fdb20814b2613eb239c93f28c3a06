I"o<p>As of late I’ve really been discovering the power of affirmations and their effects on my life. A long time ago I had tossed affirmations aside, with the thought that they really weren’t effective or useful. This was probably because I wasn’t committed to using them for long enough, or I wasn’t really focusing on them as I wrote or spoke them aloud.</p>
