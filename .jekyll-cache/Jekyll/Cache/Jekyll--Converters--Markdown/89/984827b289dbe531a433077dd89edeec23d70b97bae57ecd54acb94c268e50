I"†	<p>While listening to the audio-book version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594485259/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594485259&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=escapicom-20&amp;linkId=SDUQPSSWUHWJAWEZ"><em>The Dark Side of the Light Chasers</em></a>, I heard Debbie Ford say something that really¬†resonated with me.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a part in the book where she‚Äôs talking to a workshop attendee about the idea of doing anger release work, and how that attendee may actually be keeping fat on her body to protect her from her suppressed emotions.</p>

<p>Yes this sounds a little quaky, but I thought about it and I realized that I don‚Äôt often express my anger. This got me wondering how and what kind of effect avoiding anger is having on my life.</p>

<p>An exercise Debbie suggests to release emotions is to take a plastic wiffle ball bat and repeatedly hit a soft pillow with it while shouting obscenities and releasing all of the anger that you never released towards something or whomever has thoroughly upset you in your life.</p>

<p>I decided to do a variation of this exercise, by putting on some boxing gloves and thinking back to my childhood when I felt defenseless or angry towards ‚Äúbullies‚Äù or authority figures. I then released all of this emotion¬†on my Body Opponent Bag, yelling and saying all of the things I never said in these past memories. At the end of this, which was around 10 minutes of work, I felt exhausted.</p>

<p>The release of all of this emotion felt amazing though. I noticed something interesting too, when I think back to these memories they now seem more faded in my mind. In other words, I feel as if these memories don‚Äôt stand out as much when I think back to them after I‚Äôve done an exhausting round of anger release work on them.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done it for three days now as part of my morning workouts at home and I feel much better throughout the day. I‚Äôm going to keep it up until I feel that I‚Äôve released everything I‚Äôve bottled up over my lifetime. There may just be something to this.</p>

<p>In the mean time, ask yourselves this: What emotions you may not be expressing properly? How might suppressing these emotions be affecting your daily life?</p>

<p>You may be surprised, like I was, to find that releasing¬†these emotions is an incredibly liberating experience.</p>
