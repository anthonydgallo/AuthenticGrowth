I"‡<p>One question that struck a chord with me several months ago, and continues to shape my life, is this:</p>

<p><strong>¬†‚ÄùAre you too busy being a human doing, to realize you‚Äôre a human being?‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>Enlightenment. Bam. That feeling of a click in my mind, a knowing that this thought would change my current life.</p>

<p>After hearing this question and¬†absorbing the thought for a few seconds, the person followed it with:</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe you need to allow yourself just to <em>be</em>.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>And with that my whole mindset took a shift in a new direction.</strong></p>

<p>I never quite realize how much I was intellectualizing just about every aspect of my life.</p>

<p>I left that moment realizing how much I had really given up on certain areas of life that are so vital to the human experience.</p>

<p>One example was the area of music. Sure, I loved music, but before this conversation I had always chosen to listen to audiobooks when I drove, period.</p>

<p>Was this so bad? I thought not, until I realized that the primary belief driving this <em>need</em> to listen to audiobooks while I drove was:</p>

<p>**<em>‚ÄúI need to be doing something in order to be valuable‚Äù</em> **</p>

<p>Which stems from the primary belief of:</p>

<p><strong><em>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough‚Äù</em></strong></p>

<p>Wow. Talk about awareness into a deep underlying belief.</p>

<p>After realizing that all of this crazy entrepreneurial stress I was putting on myself stemmed from a deeper belief that I wasn‚Äôt good enough, my world opened up.</p>

<p><strong>¬†It was like a door had opened, a window raised, the room made brighter.</strong></p>

<p>Rather than seeing the world as something I have to conquer and seeing every activity I do as something I NEED to do no matter what, I found freedom in the moment.</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôll just reference the title of this post now, and say that my To-do lists began to get much <em>much</em> smaller</strong></p>

<p>I caught myself adding things, reading books, and signing up for programs that I was only signing up for because I thought <em>I wasn‚Äôt good enough as I was</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs still very much true that books, programs, and videos can be beneficial for growth. Its still true that I read a lot, sign up for programs and strive to learn.</p>

<p><strong>But the difference now is that the <em>choice</em> is with me. It is an OPTION, not a necessity. There is no stress involved. I don‚Äôt have to do anything.</strong></p>

<p>I still write to-do lists, and I still keep my life very organized. But things have changed.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen for you, when you realize how superficial most of your <em>planned tasks</em> are?</strong></p>

<p>I challenge you, reader, to catch yourself when you feel you <em>HAVE</em> to do something and in that moment take a breath and just think‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat if I didn‚Äôt really have to do this, what would happen? What other options are there?‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>The secret to living a happier more fulfilled life is in realizing just how many other options are available to you during any given moment.</strong></p>

<p>Go ahead and destroy your to-do list for a day.</p>

<p>Widdle it down to the most fundamental necessities and live your life like you have all of the options in the world.</p>
