I"Û<p>Conscious Eating is one of the most fundamental changes that anyone can make to enjoy their lives more.</p>

<p><strong>We get so caught up in our days that we end up scoffing down our food without even tasting it.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes weâ€™re looking forward to a meal so much at that nice fancy restaurant, then before you know it the meal is over and you didnâ€™t even taste a bite.</p>

<p>How can you learn to enjoy your food more? How can you make this behavior something that becomes automatic, so you donâ€™t even have to think about it?</p>

<p><strong>Hereâ€™s how you do it:</strong></p>

<p>Sit down with a nice, fresh apple and prepare to do nothing for the next 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p><em>I want you to put your phone away and imagine that all of your worries areÂ far, far away.</em></p>

<p><strong>All you have to do for the next 5-10 minutes is sit there with this delicious apple, and start eating it.</strong></p>

<p>As you sit in this chair, take a bite of the apple and just notice how sweet and delicious it tastes.</p>

<p><strong>Eat this thing like you are a Greek god eating one of the most cherished fruits in the world.</strong></p>

<p>Donâ€™t chomp it down, chew it slowly and breathe. Just try it.</p>

<p><strong>As you are chewing this apple, take a deep breathe and allow yourself to actually taste the richness and flavor of the apple.</strong></p>

<p>Consciously focus on your tongue, teeth, and cheeks as your chew.Â Notice the texture, the scent, the sweet or tart taste.</p>

<p>When youâ€™re done, sit for a moment and say Thank You for that unusual experience.</p>

<p><strong>Its not every day that you actually take the time to put all other things aside and appreciate the food you readily have available to you.</strong></p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested, try this experiment the next time you walk past your counter and spot an apple just sitting there.</p>

<p><strong>Once you start to appreciate your food and eat consciously, the richness of flavors will stand out more, and you will enjoy your food more.</strong></p>

<p>As a side note, I would also say that eating consciously actually helps me eat normal portions. Its hard to overeat when youâ€™re conscious of every bite and listening to your body.</p>
