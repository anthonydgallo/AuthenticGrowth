I"á<p>Ahhh reading. Thereâ€™s nothing like it and I love reading books whether they be physical, ebooks, or an audio version. When growing up, weâ€™re always told â€œyou should read more!â€ Warren Buffet and Bill Gates (both at one point in their lives holding the title of richest person in the world) has been known to read voraciously. And with all this, even knowing that reading improves our lives in so many ways, many still find it hard to take the time to read a book.Â </p>
