I"∑<p><em><strong>‚ÄúFlow with whatever may happen and let your mind be free. Stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. This is the ultimate [sensation].‚Äù - Lao Tzu</strong></em></p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt written about this a lot on Authentic Growth, but Qi Gong and other energy meditations (as I like to call them) have had a noticeable¬†impact on my well-being and my life. I first learned about the idea of energy therapy from a book I read maybe 10 years ago called Energy Medicine. In this book, Donna Eden discussed her practice of moving the body‚Äôs natural energy (or chi) around in order to promote health and proper circulation, among other things, throughout the body. Since then, I also underwent 40 hours of instructional training in Qi Gong, which is the Chinese chi-based meditation practice that¬†Tai Chi originates from.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Microcosmic orbit:</strong></p>

<p>The Microcosmic Orbit is a classic Taoist Meditation for circulating chi through different meridian channels and connecting acupuncture points throughout the body. I first learned about it two years ago and have since used it on numerous occasions to improve my health, relax, and as a form of rejuvenating meditation. It is a great starting point for Qi Gong, energy meditation and cultivating chi in general.</p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of doing the Microcosmic orbit:</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve used the microcosmic orbit frequently when I feel a cold coming on, to relax the body and focus chi, and even to balance myself. This exercise is a great addition to a normal meditation practice because¬†it requires you to¬†clear your mind, focus your attention (in this case on acupuncture points) and relax your body. After running through the orbit three or four times slowly, I‚Äôve felt a definite ease in my body and at times a charged, focused rejuvenation after opening my eyes.</p>

<p><strong>How exactly do you do the Microcosmic orbit:</strong></p>

<p>Although it‚Äôs a little bit microsoft-painty, I really like¬†how the below diagram lays out the microcosmic orbit. The goal here is to center yourself, clear your mind, and start your meditation by focusing on the Dan Tien (where the start arrow is on the diagram) until you feel your attention pinpoint on that area. You then proceed through each point on this diagram, moving down from the Dan Tien then up through the acupuncture points on the back, over the head and back down the points on the front of the body.</p>

<p><strong>If the instructions sound simple it‚Äôs because¬†I‚Äôve tried not to over complicate it. Here are some extra¬†tips¬†that will really help you benefit from this exercise:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Close your eyes while doing the microcosmic orbit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you are in a quiet area where you won‚Äôt be disturbed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visualize a white or gold ball of energy from the beginning of the exercise, moving it through each acupuncture point</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to feel each point before moving onto the next point</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When moving from one point to the next, visualize connecting them until the full orbit is connected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was taught you need to touch the tongue to¬†the upper palate of the mouth to fully connect the orbit, so do that</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run through the microcosmic orbit freely while taking deep breathes, and enjoy the process</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>As a seeker on AuthenticGrowth.com, your goal is to accumulate whatever knowledge can best help you enhance and enjoy your life. I‚Äôve grown through including Qi Gong and the Microcosmic Orbit in my weekly practice, and I hope you can benefit from my¬†short introduction to this ancient technique. Before you go, try shutting your eyes and running through the microcosmic orbit once slowly for about two minutes. Afterwards, I hope you will notice a difference and seek out more information for expanding your practice.</p>
