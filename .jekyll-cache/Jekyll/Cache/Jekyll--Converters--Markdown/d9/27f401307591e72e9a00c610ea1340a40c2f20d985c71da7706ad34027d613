I"Ë<p><strong>Most people are looking for guidance on how to think. The world is too complex.</strong></p>

<p>This is a thought Iâ€™ve been having a lot recently as I look at all of the online culture creations and fads that are so prominent in our newfeeds.</p>

<p>Whether it be political ideals, the keto diet, or bitcoiners - youâ€™ll notice that many of the followers all use the same words to describe their ideas and beliefs.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t a coincidence - itâ€™s because as humans we generally look for someone or something to guide us. For a group to belong to, for something to change our lives, for something to share on social media and say that we are a part of.</p>

<p><strong>And I believe the future will show us that more and more of these â€˜thought groupsâ€™ will continue to pervade our society and grow with online sharing.</strong></p>

<p>If I was going to start a following today, the first thing I would do is come up with a code language for the things that we would do as part of our group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>â€˜Reading Booksâ€™ would be DLKing (Downloading Knowledge).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€˜Working Outâ€™ would be GMing (Gaining mass)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€˜Meditatingâ€™ would be CTMing (Clearing The Mind)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Everyday Iâ€™d DLK, GM, and CTM. The group would be so legit as we all talk about how much weâ€™ve GUâ€™d that week (Growthed Up - a term for being better than you were last week).</p>

<p><strong>The shared language of these groups is a part of what builds group cohesion. It creates a sort of in-group/out-group mentality which appears to be a part of the natural human mind.</strong></p>

<p>This is all not to say that these groups are necessarily negative. I for one lost 35lbs on the keto diet and I also traded bitcoin back in 2013 and believed it was revolutionary.</p>

<p>The problem with calling out this brainwashing/latching on/group cohesion is that in-group members may feel that you are attacking them. Thatâ€™s not what people are generally doing when they bring up flaws in groupthink, but nonetheless you will find defenders of each ideology. This is a natural mechanism when you feel something that changed your life is under attack - but it is also a big problem for the believers.</p>

<p>When you feel your thoughts are under attack - you no longer listen to reasonable arguments. Thereâ€™s a great book called <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2XeigYB">When Prophecy Fails</a></strong> that basically showed that when peoplesâ€™ worldviews start to have cracks in them - rather than objectively realizing these flaws, often times people grow more adamant in their beliefs and fight back.</p>

<p><strong>Logically this doesnâ€™t make sense, but psychologically it might.</strong> For example - if youâ€™ve told all your family, friends, and relatives that keto was amazing for your health, and then a study comes out that says it may lead to intestinal lining issues - your worldview is under attack. Youâ€™ve invested a portion of your personality into something that could have unintentionally hurt the people you love. This creates massive cognitive dissonance - and when we feel cognitive dissonance we begin to lose reason. Believers will attack legitimate studies and get thousands of retweets from fellow believers - even if objectively society would be better knowing the truth.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know that there is a solution for this other than educating our society, starting with children, on critical thinking and cognitive biases. This is why I spent a year or so reading tens of books on the subject - because I couldnâ€™t understand why some things were the way they were or why people react or overlook things that seem objectively obvious. After immersing myself in it I feel I have a much better understanding now - but I do wonder whether society will ever adapt this knowledge on a wide scale.
