I"L<p>After chatting with EFT Founder Gary Craig in a <strong><a href="http://www.authenticgrowth.com/eft-gary-craig/">previous post</a></strong>, I decided it was time to do a write-up on EFT itself. I can’t begin to say how much this technique has changed my life. I first discovered tapping, also know as Emotional Freedom Technique, back in high school. It wasn’t until the summer after my freshmen year in college that I really took the practice to heart. The technique involves tapping on a series of points on your upper body about 7-10 times while thinking of a past memory, experience, or feeling which upset or distressed. After going through a series of statements that keep you focused on the negative experience, the negative association to that memory begins to fade away as you do several rounds of tapping on these points.</p>
