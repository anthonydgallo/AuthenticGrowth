I"‰<p><strong>Have you reached a point in your life where you want a change, but you don‚Äôt know where to start?</strong></p>

<p>I reached that point back in 2009, a turning point in my life. Events had me feeling helpless, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, so I looked up at the sky and shouted out ‚ÄúHelp me, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with myself anymore.‚Äù</p>

<p>It would‚Äôve been great to say that the clouds instantly opened up in the sky, and that lightning came down and made everything better for me in that moment. But that didn‚Äôt happen.</p>

<p>Instead, I was given an insight. The thought occurred to me that everything I was experiencing at the moment was a result of the decisions I had made in my life prior, and that if I wanted to have a better life all I had to do was change my behaviors, my thoughts, and my actions, and that everything would be okay.</p>

<p><strong>Every thought, decision, and action I took prior to looking up in the sky at that moment was what had culminated in me feeling helpless and alone. It was also at that moment that a spark of new life was born, with the idea that I was capable of changing just about anything that bothered me beforehand.</strong></p>

<p>In the month‚Äôs following this revelation, I began to change every habit and belief I ever held about myself. I realized that the way life had been was no longer the way it had to be. I started reading books, a LOT of books, and working on the beliefs I held about the world around me. Amazing things began happening once I took responsibility for my own thoughts and actions, and I realized that my life had taken a new and exciting turn.</p>
