title: Back At It Again - Why I'm Back Online and More Excited Than Ever

Hello everybody,

I haven't blogged or hosted a serious website in over 7 years now, but I've decided its time to get back into the game. I'm going to host this one to start, to have a place where I can share my thoughts about how I've been improving my life lately and how my world has changed. On this site I'll be keeping an updated reading list with books that I've read (I read over 100 a year now) that I feel have had a significant impact on the way I perceive the world, or that have kicked me out of old ways of thinking and brought new perspectives into my life. I'll also be posting new ideas I've discovered, new programs that have significantly impacted me, and different experiences I've had that have shifted my thought processes in, what I feel, is a better direction towards success and achievement.

The reason I'm more excited than ever is that I'm starting to see the truly unlimited amount of space there is on the internet for sharing great wisdom and picking up a ton of useful knowledge and experience from other people. I've discovered so many new podcasts, ebooks, programs, and all sorts of material this year that most people have no clue even exist, and this website will be a place for me to post my findings as well talk about how these things have made my life better.

In Short:Â If it is on this website- it has probably made a big difference in my life, and may help you as well.

Thanks all for tuning in and you'll be seeing some good content soon.

-Anthony
