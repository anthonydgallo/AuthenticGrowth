On my week in between jobs, I experienced a sudden burst of inspiration.

I was going to jump out of an airplane.

It was one of those things where a friend of mine asked me if I was willing to go that weekend, and I had a split second to decide.

Of course, we ended up pushing it back a week, and we almost didn't go that weekend either (A few clouds scared some of the group away), but in the end me and one other friend went and it was an absolutely exhilarating experience.

What most people don't realize is that the falling out of an airplane aspect actually really isn't that scary. You have no time to think, you're literally just cruising through the air.

It felt like I was on a roller coaster heading straight down, without any tracks beneath me but still with a sense of security.

The scariest part is really just the wait, when you're sitting on the edge of the plane looking down and then bam- you fall out.

Check out the video below from my dive and let me know what you think, it was pretty freakin sweet.

Also, for the next 3-4 hours after skydiving, I had an adrenaline rush that I could only describe as saying that things felt like they were moving slower, that my body was more perceptive, and that humans are really not evolutionarily prepared to fall out of airplanes. I don't think skydiving is paleo, but I might have to ask Mark Sisson about that one.

If you ever go skydiving, get the video! I remember and relive so much more of the skydive by watching the video than compared to what my brain actually remembers from the experience
