Now that I've gotten over the fear my getting back into the online game, I wanted to make a post reflecting exactly why I am here creating AuthenticGrowth.com, and what my purpose is in designing and putting out this content for you.

Over the past few years a lot of things have happened that have really changed my perspective of life and reality. In 2009, my life hit what I now think of as the lowest of the lows. I thought everything was somewhat hopeless for me, and I was considering dropping out of school and earning money through part-time work. Luckily, with a few great books and a little bit of divine intervention, I turned my life around and regained an amazing connection with the universe. I truly realized my power to create the things I wanted in my life. In 2013, I lost 35 pounds going on a ketogenic diet, going against everything that people thought should work from a nutritional perspective. Since January 2013, I've read over 250 books, many of which can be found here on my Reading List or in my book reviews. All of these books have significantly impacted the way I perceive the world, which is why I am here to share them with you. I've removed countless bad habits from my life, and replaced them with truly empowering and healthier virtues that have made my life that much more fulfilling.

Now I am here running AuthenticGrowth.com- wanting to share everything I've learned with you, bringing you along for the journey with each new realization, and each new book or program that I feel shifts my perspective. It seems that with almost every week that goes by, I am having one realization after another, "a-ha moment" after "a-ha moment". This blog is a place for me to write about what caused me to accept these realizations and to talk about what pushed me into accepting new views of reality.

AuthenticGrowth is to be my expanding body of work. My work of art. This blog is my expression of everything I've kept to myself since I started this real personal development journey late 2009. I will document here everything I create, everything I realize, and everything that I think will help anyone out there looking to make a change in their life. This blog is for you guys as much as it is for me.

If this sounds like something that empowers you, come along for the journey. I encourage you to sign up for my email list, and keep in touch through the Facebook comments below.

I hope you all enjoy, lets get this thing started.
