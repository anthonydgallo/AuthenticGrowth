**Have you ever wanted to remove a negative memory or a thought from your mind?**

In this post, I discuss and demonstrate a technique I discovered 8 years ago that I've found effective in successfully removing or "destroying" negative feelings associated with memories from your past. This technique has been highly effective for me in correcting unresourceful states, and it only takes about 2 minutes to do the whole process.

You can perform it for yourself by reading and following the steps below

The process for this technique is as follows..<!-- more -->

**Get yourself into a negative emotional state, either by thinking back to a memory from your past or an event that made you feel unhappy, angry, sad, etc.**

While holding that emotion inside of you say OUTLOUD the following statements, starting with your current age and going down in 5 year increments until the age of 10:

I am 25, and I am experiencing this feeling
I am 20, and I am experiencing this feeling
I am 15, and I am experiencing this feeling
I am 10, and I am experiencing this feeling

**Now, you are about to reach the age of 5. Here we alter the ending slightly to ask "Am I feeling this feeling?" and we switch to 1 year increments.**

**Be sure to FOCUS on the state you want to remove!**

I am 5 years old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 4 years old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 3 years old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 2 years old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 1 year old, am I experiencing this feeling?

Continue down, using monthly ranges now, and see if you can still grasp that feeling:

I am 9 months old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 5 months old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 1 month old, am I experiencing this feeling?
I am 1 day old, am I experiencing this feeling?

At some point in this process, you should notice a reduction in the negative feeling associated with that memory or thought you were holding onto.

The idea is that at the moment you lose that negative attachment, it was either at that age or within that age range that you skipped where you acquired the ability to "feel" the negative emotion.

I'm not sure whether I believe the above statement or not, but it seems to be an interesting thing to think about as you release these negative feelings.

When I first started using this, I often felt like there was just a void left where the negative feeling used to be. It can be a surreal feeling, especially if the memory you focused on was very significant in your life.
