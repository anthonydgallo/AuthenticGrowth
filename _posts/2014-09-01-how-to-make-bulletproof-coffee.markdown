So what's all this "bullet-proof coffee" talk you're hearing about and reading in magazines these days.

The craze is this: It tastes great, its good for you, and it leaves you with in amazing state of mental clarity, focus, and energy that lasts all morning

**The basic recipe is below, this is the configuration I currently use:**

-One **[My K-cup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000DLB2FI&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=HVHLZOO34NG6RCJB)** full of [**Upgraded Coffee beans**](http://amzn.to/1CzuVa3), brewed twice in a **[Keurig](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004978NKY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004978NKY&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=BNTEWLB5MK2O6XBH)** at small cup size**:**

-One Tablespoon of **[Kerrygold Unsalted Grassfed Butter](http://kerrygoldusa.com/where-to-buy/)**:

-One Tablespoon either **[Now Food's MCT Oil](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C)** or Dave Asprey's[** Upgraded Brain Octane Oil**](http://amzn.to/18vhxbP) (Caprylic Acid)**:**

**Put this all in a blender for 30 seconds and pour it out.** Take a sip and feel amazing. It sounds weird, but it tastes great. The butter is almost like a nice cream, and the MCT Oil adds a consistency to it that makes the coffee feel almost like a latte. Make sure you don't put it in a styrofoam cup (oil interacts with styrofoam), and besides that you'll be good.

As an added bonus, I often add two tablespoons of **[Great Lake's Hydrolasized Collagen Protein](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG7EDU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005KG7EDU&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=AZEW6566THEXTZMR)** to the coffee**:**

I have to give Dave Asprey credit here for starting a movement here. Bullet-proof coffee is an awesome way to start your day and it has definitely had an impact on my mornings over the last several months. I've been following his Bulletproof Radio Podcast for almost a year now, listening to every episode he's put out. He has done a lot to educate people about the benefits of high fat diets and the importance of grassfed foods. While I believe that Dave's margins are quite high on his products, I do feel that the information I've learned from his podcast warranted a few purchases from his upgraded self store. I haven't been able to find a good source of liquid Caprylic Acid (Brain Octane Oil) besides Dave's, so I often do purchase that from him as well as the Upgraded Beans, but I also find **[Now Food's MCT Oil](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C)** to work just fine and it is half the cost.

I challenge everyone reading this to go out, grab some grassfed butter from Wholefoods or Trader Joe's, grab some **[MCT Oil](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRY8A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0019LRY8A&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=77I52TUVBDRTME2C)** here, and use whatever coffee beans you have or splurge on the Upgrade Self beans.

Just try it, I really believe you will like the results.
