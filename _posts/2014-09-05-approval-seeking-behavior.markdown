I'm going to start making this a weekly practice of mine, reviewing the realizations I've made during the week and keep a log of everything I am learning.

As a practicing Holosync user it seems that my awareness is increasing each day, and with that I feel each week I am understanding something new that I have never understood before in my life.

This week's realization:

**It is not necessary to give people unsolicited advice, and you don't have to know everything. **

In fact, its great not knowing everything. It keeps your mind open to finding solutions that you otherwise might have missed because of ideas and patterns that have become ingrained in your mind.

Not knowing everything is actually freeing, it allows you to participate in the wonder of the world and to associate with people and enjoy the experience of the human condition.

I used to feel like I had to say something related to any topic that came up in conversation. I would add anything to the conversation just to feel accepted, whether it was tidbits from an article or ideas from a book I recently read.

This week I realized that all of that is completely unnecessary, and was the result of an ingrained belief that in order to be accepted, I should try and tell people things to gain their acceptance.

No longer will I practice this. I've realized now that doing this was really just a cry for acceptance. I don't need to know everything, and I certainly don't need to act like I know everything to gain acceptance.

This was my opening myself this week and putting myself out there a bit. I had this realization while reading the book **[No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762415339/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0762415339&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=HZCCBN72ZYWLWJVD)**, and wow did it hit me like a ton of bricks.

Cheers to all your weekly realizations, I hope they're as powerful as this one was for me.
