Since the dawn of Smartphone civilization, everyone has thought that multi-tasking is the ultimate goal, the _ultimate_ skill!

Well I'm here to tell you that something has seriously been lost with us trying to multi-task every activity of our life, and I'm not alone in this sentiment.

I read [**_The Power of Full Engagement_**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743226755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743226755&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=QUHBKHJHQFT3NPEE) recently and it really got me thinking about the idea and value of being fully engaged in any given activity.

How many things can you do at once? I think I can do many things, maybe 10-15 solid things at one time. But here's the **real** question- How many things are you ACTUALLY doing?

I made a startling discovery and I'd like to teach all of you the clear distinction that allowed me to improve my workouts, increase my peace, improve my<!-- more --> personal presence, and learn a whole lot more in the process.

The idea was simple, yet powerful. Instead of bringing my smartphone with me to the gym, running, or even meditating, I replaced it with the latest version of the **[iPod Shuffle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC)**.

That wasn't the only step though, I also loaded the iPod Shuffle with a variety of _educational content_, such as podcasts, audiobooks, and one long meditation track for meditating, and nothing else.

What? I bought an **[iPod Shuffle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEECI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0097BEECI&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=GZTQJP35GMIHPVXC)** so that I can do something my PHONE can already do? And filled it with education stuff?? How did that change your life Anthony?

Yes, I figured you'd ask about that. Well, buying this iPod Shuffle has changed everything when it comes to how I workout, my meditation sessions, and yes even my walks or runs around town.

Before, knowing that my phone was in my pocket, I would always check it at the gym. Despite multiple attempts to limit this activity, we always _feel_ that there is something waiting for us, right there on our phones in our pocket and I'd inevitably end up checking it.

Since I switched to using my iPod Shuffle at the gym and leaving my phone at home, I no longer have the "luxury" of feeding the urge to check my notifications, text, email, or anything.

By doing this, I have _forced_ myself to workout and do nothing else. I can't check if you text me, babe! I can't check if I got an email about the latest information product I should buy! Now its just me and the weights, or me and nature as I do my early morning runs.

The reason I filled it up with only educational material, which I usually listen to on my phone anyway, is so that I can conveniently focus this device as a personal development device, which I know happily dub my "KnowledgePod". I have everything audio-related that I want to focus on, all in one space, and I update my iTunes playlists daily, adding and removing material as I go through it.

Now, whenever I go to the gym, or whenever I go for a walk or meditate, **I'm not allowing the outside world to distract me** from my exercise goals, nor am I allowing the world to follow me as I go on my contemplating walks or runs.

I am incredibly happy with this separation of tasks, and I think the less I bring my phone places, the more I allow my mind to do what it does best, which is **_coming up with great ideas_**.
