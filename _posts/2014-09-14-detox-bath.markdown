Part of living a healthy life is helping your body release some of the stuff it has accumulated over the years. I've experimented with Bentonite Clay and Epsom salt baths before, but until yesterday I had never tried taking Niacin(Vitamin B3) to help enhance a detox bath. I came across the recipe below, decided to give it a try, and the results were awesome.<!-- more -->

**This Is The Recipe You Should Use:**
**Step 1: **About 30 minutes prior to bathing, ingest one **[250MG tablet of ](http://amzn.to/2a3eI2X)[Niacin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020IAWI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00020IAWI&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=SZH3372QTVNDZHR5)** (Vitamin B3). Make sure you take the "flushing" kind of Niacin, which dilates your blood vessels and causes the skin to flush red for a bit. **[This](http://amzn.to/2a3eI2X) **is the exact Niacin I purchased. There are other kinds that do not cause the skin flush, and thus won't work well for this detox, so be sure to grab the correct one.

**Step 2:** Fill the bath with hot water, hot enough to relax your muscles and open your pores.

**Step 3:** Crack open a window to get some ventilation as the room will get very warm.

**Step 4: **Pour 1 cup of **[Baking Soda](http://amzn.to/2a3fixM)**, 1 cup of **[Epsom salt](http://amzn.to/29Zyjq3) **and 1-3 tablespoons of crushed **[Ginger Powder](http://amzn.to/2a3fvky)** into the hot bath.

**Step 5:** Mix it all together in the bath, grab yourself a bottle of water and a skin brush or loofah, and hop in the bath.



**Personal Note:** The Niacin will make your skin flush red, including your face and arms. This goes away about an hour after your bath. So if you're going to do this, make sure you don't have plans shortly afterwards seeing as you will be red as a tomato for about an hour. Your body will also be in a detoxification phase for a few hours post-bath, so you should give it time to rest during this time.

The Niacin and Epsom salts are the most important elements of this bath recipe, while the Ginger and Baking soda add a very beneficial bonus to the detox powers of the bath. I'm going to repeat myself here- make sure you buy **[the flushing form](http://amzn.to/2a3eI2X)** of Niacin for this as you will not experience the same results using other forms of Niacin.

**Why and How Does This Work:**
The combination of Ginger, Baking Soda, and Epsom help to draw out toxins from your pores, which the hot bath opens. The Niacin works internally to dilate your blood vessels, allowing your body to release stored toxins specifically from fat cells near smaller capillaries so you can sweat them out through your pores.

**My Results Below:**
At first I took the Niacin right when I began putting the bath together. In hindsight, I would have taken it 20-30 minutes before I started running the bath as it took some time for my skin to flush. Once your skin flushes, you _will_ know it. It came on pretty suddenly for me and I felt in a tingling sensation in my face and arms as they started turning red.

The bath itself felt amazing. Anyone who has taken an Epsom salt bath for sport's injuries knows that even a hot Epsom salt bath feels great, but this was something else. For the remainder of the day I had a very strong sense of well being. Keep in mind that the detox aspect of this bath also drains you just a little bit. Make sure you have a bottle of cold water with you while you undergo this process, you will get very thirsty.

**How To Improve Your Results:** Another beneficial supplement to add for this is **[Activated Charcoal](http://amzn.to/2aiURib)**. You can ingest 2-3 capsules of activate charcoal towards the end of this bath, and it will help bind toxins that are being released internally so that these contaminants can be easily carried out of your body. I took 3 capsules of activated charcoal about 25 minutes after starting my bath. Note- be sure to take the activated charcoal towards the end of your bath and not at the same time as the Niacin, as the Activated Charcoal will absorb some of the Niacin leaving less for your body.

I loved the way I felt after doing this detox bath and will be doing it again next weekend! If you decide to do it, let me know what your results are in the comments below!
