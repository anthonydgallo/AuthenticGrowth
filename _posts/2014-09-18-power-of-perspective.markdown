Quick Note: This is a short post, and though it is thought provoking! Be prepared for some mild, even depressing, self-introspection.

**Now Imagine this: **You're 90 years old, in a hospital bed, looking out into the world.

You know your time has come, and you can't help but wish you had just one more day to live on this earth.

**How much would you pay for that one more day?**

Think about it, _actually_ _come up with_ a number.

Now, for the next important question.

**If you would pay that much for one more day, why are you spending your day the way you are now?**

"Now" as in this week, last week, yesterday. Whether it was laying in bed, worrying about things, doing things you don't love.

**Every day is worth just as much as what you would pay for that one extra day at the end of your life**.

Knowing this, what have you've been putting off doing?

**I ask myself these questions every month or two, to see where my heads at. It may benefit AuthenticGrowth readers to do the same.**
