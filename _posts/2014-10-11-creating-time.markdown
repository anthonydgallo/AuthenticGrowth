_**"I have all of the time, money, success, love, and happiness in the world"**_


This affirmation has been working wonders for me lately. The process started about two weeks ago when I was feeling overwhelmed with the amount of things I felt I had to do.




I started asking myself how I could get more free time in my life, when this startling realization came into my head.




**The amount of things that you have to do are almost entirely determined by you. You can create more free time by being more selective.**




Its not a matter of having "no time", its a matter of how you choose to spend all of the time you have. Everyone has the same amount of time in a day.




Martin Luther King Jr. had the same amount of time in a day as you do right now. Mother Teresea had the same amount of time.




Once I started working in this affirmation into my morning journaling (the Morning Pages), a whole slew of things started to change in my reality.




I started realizing that I was giving myself a ton of things to do, that if I cut them out my life wouldn't even really change much, and I'd have a ton more free time.




Suddenly I realized all of these books, articles, audios, and other programs that I thought I had to read lost all of their appeal to me. I realized I didn't have to read that persons free eBook, or listen to that Audio CD that comes with Success Magazine. I could consciously CHOOSE what felt the most important for my development at any given time.


**By focusing specifically on what mattered most towards my development, the few key factors, I opened up tens of hours of free time each week.**


By being selective, I cut out all of the garbage material that I was reading through and processing in my mind. At one point I thought all of these things were necessary to my growth, but really _I was overloading myself_.




I can't begin to describe how powerful a realization this has been for me, or what kind of impact this is going to have on my future.




All I know now is that affirmations certainly have a powerful effect on me, and I never thought they would amount to anything.


**Before I started writing out this affirmation every morning, I thought there was literally no way for me to make more free time. Now I have plenty of it.**


The outcome and experiential evidence I've gained from the past two weeks has been eye-opening, and will certainly effect the way I construct affirmations going forward.
