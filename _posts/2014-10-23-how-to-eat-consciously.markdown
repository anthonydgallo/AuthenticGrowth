Conscious Eating is one of the most fundamental changes that anyone can make to enjoy their lives more.

**We get so caught up in our days that we end up scoffing down our food without even tasting it.**

Sometimes we're looking forward to a meal so much at that nice fancy restaurant, then before you know it the meal is over and you didn't even taste a bite.

How can you learn to enjoy your food more? How can you make this behavior something that becomes automatic, so you don't even have to think about it?

**Here's how you do it:**

Sit down with a nice, fresh apple and prepare to do nothing for the next 5-10 minutes.

_I want you to put your phone away and imagine that all of your worries are far, far away._

**All you have to do for the next 5-10 minutes is sit there with this delicious apple, and start eating it.**

As you sit in this chair, take a bite of the apple and just notice how sweet and delicious it tastes.

**Eat this thing like you are a Greek god eating one of the most cherished fruits in the world.**

Don't chomp it down, chew it slowly and breathe. Just try it.

**As you are chewing this apple, take a deep breathe and allow yourself to actually taste the richness and flavor of the apple.**

Consciously focus on your tongue, teeth, and cheeks as your chew. Notice the texture, the scent, the sweet or tart taste.

When you're done, sit for a moment and say Thank You for that unusual experience.

**Its not every day that you actually take the time to put all other things aside and appreciate the food you readily have available to you.**

If you're interested, try this experiment the next time you walk past your counter and spot an apple just sitting there.

**Once you start to appreciate your food and eat consciously, the richness of flavors will stand out more, and you will enjoy your food more.**

As a side note, I would also say that eating consciously actually helps me eat normal portions. Its hard to overeat when you're conscious of every bite and listening to your body.
