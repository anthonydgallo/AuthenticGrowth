**Though we move the body, we are not the body. We barely even control it. What we feel is control, is only intent. We _will_ movement. We cannot control the biological processes.. we are just the operator.**

I posted this thought over on [Entheos.com](http://www.entheos.com/oasis) the other day, and felt the need to take the open space here on [AuthenticGrowth.com](http://AuthenticGrowth.com) and fill it with my thought process as I grow to understand the above idea.

I was walking to class last week when the thought popped into my mind "Its really odd how little I actually influence the actions of my body."

Just that thought alone was enough to really hit me hard, causing me to slow my pace as I walked into the building.

From that initial thought my mind wander in all directions. This post will be the initial accumulation of those ideas.

**Though I think I am my body, I am not really my body. When I move my arm, I have little to no influence in the mechanical process**

**All of the biological processes that occur in the movement of my arm are controlled by something that isn't conscious.**

**I only control the will and intent to move the arm. There is an aspect of my existence that is unfathomable in its ability to effect biological change.**

If I am not controlling any of the biological processes in the functioning of my body, this has me thinking that I really only control very little in terms of my functioning.

I control the inputs, namely food-water-air, but the actions that my body undergoes to keep me alive are all done on their own.

If I am not in control of my own body, what am I in control of?

**If I am not in control of my own body.... what am I?**

I am the thought, the will and intent to be.. to move.. to live

I am just the operator.

But where does the thought come from?

**I control the "black box" and what it does (the body), but I am completely unaware of what goes on inside of the "black box".**

Is personality just a program? Am I no different... am I like a computer with the ability to feel and express emotion?

Can I edit the program? I think that is what AuthenticGrowth.com is all about, realizing that change in the program is possible.

What lies beyond the "program"?

I do not want to intellectualize any of this.. it is very easy to spew information read from the thousands of self-help books that are abundant these days.

**I want to feel the answer to all of these questions.**

**Beyond the program is a state of being. Beyond the being is an existence that completely takes us out of the program, or so I feel.**

Maybe this is where the movie _The Matrix_ became such a hit.. because it allowed us to think and experience something very close to reality.. in a way our minds would accept.

I'm feeling these thoughts so deeply, like I am on the brink of something.

I have the desire to explore more:

Is animal life living in the state that my body lives in (the mind that controls all of my biological functioning), without the consciousness of intent?

**Or are animals in the same exact state as us, with conscious control, just a different map of reality (not the human/societal view)**

Does this suggest that we have been completely selfish in our evaluation of other species of animal life?

Does my body try to tell me things? (The answer to this is yes)

What else can I do besides intend and will to move and live?

**What can I expend my energy on, if not on just societal and human life? What is beyond this?**

Are there others who have found the solution to the above questions? If they did exist, would they be able to function in normal society?

Where are they?

I think I will continue to think along this line of thought many many years to come, as the answers come to me one way or another.

**Enjoy your thoughts.**
