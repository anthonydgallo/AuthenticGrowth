One question that struck a chord with me several months ago, and continues to shape my life, is this:

** "Are you too busy being a human doing, to realize you're a human being?"**

Enlightenment. Bam. That feeling of a click in my mind, a knowing that this thought would change my current life.

After hearing this question and absorbing the thought for a few seconds, the person followed it with:

"Maybe you need to allow yourself just to _be_."

**And with that my whole mindset took a shift in a new direction.**

I never quite realize how much I was intellectualizing just about every aspect of my life.

I left that moment realizing how much I had really given up on certain areas of life that are so vital to the human experience.

One example was the area of music. Sure, I loved music, but before this conversation I had always chosen to listen to audiobooks when I drove, period.

Was this so bad? I thought not, until I realized that the primary belief driving this _need_ to listen to audiobooks while I drove was:

**_"I need to be doing something in order to be valuable"_ **

Which stems from the primary belief of:

**_"I'm not good enough"_**

Wow. Talk about awareness into a deep underlying belief.

After realizing that all of this crazy entrepreneurial stress I was putting on myself stemmed from a deeper belief that I wasn't good enough, my world opened up.

** It was like a door had opened, a window raised, the room made brighter.**

Rather than seeing the world as something I have to conquer and seeing every activity I do as something I NEED to do no matter what, I found freedom in the moment.

**I'll just reference the title of this post now, and say that my To-do lists began to get much _much_ smaller**

I caught myself adding things, reading books, and signing up for programs that I was only signing up for because I thought _I wasn't good enough as I was_

It's still very much true that books, programs, and videos can be beneficial for growth. Its still true that I read a lot, sign up for programs and strive to learn.

**But the difference now is that the _choice_ is with me. It is an OPTION, not a necessity. There is no stress involved. I don't have to do anything.**

I still write to-do lists, and I still keep my life very organized. But things have changed.

**What will happen for you, when you realize how superficial most of your _planned tasks_ are?**

I challenge you, reader, to catch yourself when you feel you _HAVE_ to do something and in that moment take a breath and just think...

"What if I didn't really have to do this, what would happen? What other options are there?"

**The secret to living a happier more fulfilled life is in realizing just how many other options are available to you during any given moment.**

Go ahead and destroy your to-do list for a day.

Widdle it down to the most fundamental necessities and live your life like you have all of the options in the world.
