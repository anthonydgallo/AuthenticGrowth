A topic that has come up a lot recently when discussing things with colleagues is how difficult it is to let go of things.

**Its apparent that people feel they gain something by holding onto an issue, a problem, or (worst of all) a past event.**

In reality, if you're holding onto a past grievance that can no longer be dealt with, or has no way of being changed in the near future, nobody gains from this.

**In fact, by holding onto past resentments, you actually _inhibit_ your ability to make forward progress, choosing instead to spend your precious focus in the past.**

Luckily, there are many quite effective methods out there to help you ease your way into letting things go and to regain your personal power.

**My absolute favorite technique come from the [Sedona Method](http://sedona.com) train of thought, originally discovered by a man named Lester Levenson, who I greatly admire.**

To truly gain a complete understanding of the Sedona Method release process, I highly suggest you read [**The Sedona Method**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0971933413/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0971933413&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=WPGHHMYGIZVKRR25) book, written by Hale Dwoskin (who was featured in _The Secret_).

The simple Sedona Method process goes something like this:

**Think of an issue you're experiencing, a grievance, or a feeling of negativity in your life and ask yourself the following questions:**



 	
  1. **Can I welcome this feeling?** (Wait for an intuitive answer. Even if it is 'no', accept it and move forward)

 	
  2. **Can I let this feeling go?** (Wait again for an internal, intuitive answer)

 	
  3. **Would I let this feeling go?** (Feel what it would feel like to be able to just let it go. Wait for an intuitive answer and proceed)

 	
  4. **When?** (Allow yourself to release this feeling, wherever you may be storing it, and experience this new freedom as it is unmasked)


**This process can seem remarkably simple at first, but allow yourself for a moment to experiment with the immense power you can gain when you allow yourself to Let Go of anything not helping you grow.**

How did that go for you? Did you notice any shifts or any changes in the feeling? If it was a big issue, you may notice the feeling actually move its position in your body.

This entire process takes a little bit of practicing, but similar to **[Emotional Freedom Technique](http://www.authenticgrowth.com/tapping/)**- you can literally begin to feel shifts in your feelings when you hit a deeply embedded emotion.

**I myself have experienced tremendous shifts and growth while focusing in on these "hard to release" emotional blocks.**

The **[Sedona Method](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0971933413/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0971933413&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=WPGHHMYGIZVKRR25)** book takes these four questions and dives deep into each major area of your life, such as relationships and financial woes, and guides the reader to release on many common and important blocks.

**One of my favorite questions to ask myself now, and to elicit a release, is this:**

**_"Can I let go of the need to want to change the way things are?"_**

I personally tend to have a propensity for wanting to control the outcomes of events in my life. Using the release process from The Sedona Method and Lester Levenson has without a doubt altered my personal growth path for the better.

In addition to the Sedona Method book, I just recently finished reading **[Happiness is Free](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVAW5N0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JVAW5N0&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=OZW4IJLTNOWM3LFU)** by Hale Dwoskin and Lesther Levenson as well, and it was so enlightening that I plan to read the other 4 books in this series as well.

**A few benefits that I have experienced while using release techniques to let go of things in my life:**



 	
  * Shifts in life-long emotional blocks

 	
  * Positive changes to my personality

 	
  * Less reactions to things that used to really _grind my gears_

 	
  * More peace in my life

 	
  * More acceptance to the way things are, less resistance, which in turn makes life better


These are just a few of the things I've experienced. Combining EFT practice with Release techniques is really a powerful way to alter your perception of reality.

**If you didn't get the hint yet, you NEED to be practicing release techniques.**

I am going to follow up this post with a write-up on the importance and power of Forgiveness, as these two topics go hand-in-hand.

In the mean time, if you have any questions- feel free to comment in the comment section below.

**Recommend books for learning and practicing Release Techniques: [The Sedona Method](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0971933413/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0971933413&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=JA4OH7AFEPM7XSWN)** and** [Happiness is Free](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVAW5N0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JVAW5N0&linkCode=as2&tag=escapicom-20&linkId=OZW4IJLTNOWM3LFU)** are both enlightening books.
