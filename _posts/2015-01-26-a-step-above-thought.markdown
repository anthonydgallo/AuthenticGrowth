**I recently finished reading Absence from Felicity, a biography of Helen Schucman, that talks about her life and how [A Course In Miracles](http://amzn.to/1DcePl2) came into being.**

There was a portion at the end of the biography that talked about praying for specifics. In this section, Helen discussed how it was better to go straight for the ultimate goal - **Love** - rather than praying for specific items or events.

**When I began going for the ultimate goal, the limitless love and acceptance of that love, I found the need to pray for specifics unnecessary**.

Specific events or items in our lives are encompassed by the over-arching concept that we are all surrounded by, and living in, a loving presence.

**Another great concept that hit me hard was the idea that words are just a second degree of separation from reality.** The first degree of separation is our perception of reality, which is filtered through our senses in our brain.Words are simply a description of the first degree of separation from reality, not true reality (which is probably incomprehensible) and so when you pray without words- you're closer to the underlying source of things.

_This idea left me incredibly intrigued, so needless to say I decided I would give it a go._<!-- more -->

**These are the steps that I went through to get to a feeling of complete peace which eventually lead me to falling asleep:**



 	
  1. Think about what you want to pray for

 	
  2. Close your eyes and begin praying in your mind, without words. Start this differently, by feeling your prayer...

 	
  3. Take a step "up" from the level of your specific _want_ or _need_, into a category.. or imagine something that encompasses all of your desires and feel love for this category.

 	
  4. Take one step further up, into what would be an acceptance that all things are ok as they are, and that you are loved, loving yourself and your intent.

 	
  5. Take one final step up, to the all-encompassing idea that God (or the Universe)'s love is what you are made of, and you can never be apart from it.


**I found this experiment really calming, and definitely brought to me a new perspective on prayer.**

At this point, after trying this new way of praying, it almost seems inefficient to pray for specific events or outcomes.

**There is no need to pray for specifics when you can pray, without words, for the ultimate goal: to realize how loved you are, as you are.**

I think this idea has opened up a new train of thought for me as I progress in my personal growth. If this post has helped you in any way, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments below.
