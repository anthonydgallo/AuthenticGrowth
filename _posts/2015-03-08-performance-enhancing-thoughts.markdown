**_“The vast majority of people are born, grow up, struggle, and go through life in misery and failure, not realizing that it would be just as easy to switch over and get exactly what they want out of life, not recognizing that the mind attracts the thing it dwells upon.” _****- Napoleon Hill**

I'm guilty. I admit it. This won't be easy, but its time that I come clean about the real reason I've found success and happiness in my life. It's hard to say it, and I didn't want to give up the edge I had in this game of life, but for the benefit of everyone reading this I can't hide it any longer.

**You see, I've been using Performance Enhancing Thoughts for the last 7 years of my life, and the results have been incredible. I have no shame for the competitive edge this has given me, for it is all of my own accord.**

Before I started using P.E.T's, my life was dictated by the world around me. Any unfortunate events that happened, I blamed on my external environment. When things didn't go my way, I pointed my finger at other people. I didn't take responsibility for my life or for the way I interpreted what was happening to me. That all changed once I was introduced to Performance Enhancing Thoughts, and I'll admit it- I'm hooked for life. I've made changes that should take years of work in mere weeks. I've seen thought patterns that used to dominate my life, dissolve overnight. I wouldn't be where I am today without the use of Performance Enhancing Thoughts.

**Though it may be taboo, Performance Enhancing Thoughts revolve around one idea: Your life becomes what you focus on. Your thoughts are the key to getting from where you are now to where you want to be.**

A lot of people reading this won't appreciate the words I'm writing here. Some P.E.T users may be scoffing at my outlandish attempt to out their secret weapon in life. Others will be filled with just as much joy as I am in sharing these powerful techniques with you. You see, many people that use P.E.Ts have always been willing to teach you how to live a better life. The problem is that in our society we are brought up to believe that our thoughts have no effect on our world. We're never taught the most important lesson of all- that _what we think, we become_. That the thoughts we think are the colors on the paintbrush that we use to paint our world.

**Performance Enhancing Thoughts are the fuel in the engine of our success. Our mind is the engine, are bodies are the vehicle, and our actions and results are the consequence of the P.E.Ts we choose to focus on.**

Replacing average, unorganized thought patterns with Performance Enhancing Thoughts (powerful, positive, success-oriented thinking) allows you to start crafting your reality. The world isn't what you think it is. Its not the events that happen to us that make us angry, its our reactions and the unmet needs of our minds that give meaning to these events around us. We are angry and unhappy not because of the way things are, but because of the way we thought things were. A change in our mental landscape makes all the difference, and Performance Enhancing Thoughts have the ability to change our experience of life completely.

**To change the way we think is the first step towards ultimate freedom. In our realization that we can influence the way we experience our lives, we gain what at first seems like a paradox: the ability to control our freedom. We give ourselves the key to unlock the shackles on our mind, to free ourselves from Plato's cave.**

With the realization that our reaction to an event is what produces our feelings about that event, we begin to experience an awakening like no other. This will, at first, feel like a completely new way of thinking. The awakening that comes when we realize we can influence and potentially transform the way we feel about the events in our life is, in essence, a re-birth. When we come into this world, we experience something so new as to be unimaginable from the point of view of an adult. With Performance Enhancing Thoughts, we are learning to live life in a new way, a way that many feel should have been taught to us on the day we came into this world. With gradual, subtle changes to our thought process, we can begin to see the world in an entirely new light.

**Performance Enhancing Thoughts clear the fog off our lenses, and allow us to see the world as it really is. Shakespeare said it best when he wrote, "for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." **

Choose to think with P.E.Ts and you will experience a world where more options are readily available to you. Before Performance Enhancing Thoughts entered my life, I used to think "That event didn't make me feel the way I wanted to feel, it didn't go how I wanted. This sucks." After bing introduced to P.E.T's, now I'm inclined to think, "That didn't go the way I had planned, what lessons can be learned from this and how can I think and act differently so that it goes better in the future?" Looking at these two outcomes, which thought process appears more intuitively powerful to you? If you chose the second one, you are inclined towards and can benefit from the use of Performance Enhancing Thoughts. To begin, start focusing on what you want in life, rather than on the random nature of events that happen around you.

**When you get triggered by an event, pause your instincts for a moment and use this as a time of reflection. Replace your thoughts, in that moment, with Performance Enhancing Thoughts, and you allow yourself to reap the benefits of a lesson that would have otherwise been lost to you.**

The world is filled with opportunities for growth. Performance Enhancing Thoughts allow us to see all of the options available to us. They allow us to learn more for each experience that comes our way, they enhance our Authentic Growth, and they improve our quality of life. With P.E.Ts, you allow yourself to clear your mental landscape, freeing up space for new possibilities. Your mind becomes fresh clay, and you are the sculptor. You begin to notice new opportunities around you, and are able to influence your life in a way that you never thought possible. Performance Enhancing Thoughts are the key to my success, and now that you have them- you will be able to move forward with creating your own life the way you want it.

**Begin today to live the life you want to live, by first realizing that our thoughts are the filter for our world. When you change your thoughts, you change your reality. What could be better than gaining that ability to transform our lives?**

I admit that Performance Enhancing Thoughts are to credit for all everything I've earned and for the accomplishments I've made in my life. I have no regrets for using them, as they are freely available to everyone. Choose now, to be a believer in the power of your own mind. With this belief, you gain the ability to craft a world to your liking. You gain the competitive advantage, for life.
