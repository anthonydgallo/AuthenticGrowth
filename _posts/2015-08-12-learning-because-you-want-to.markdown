**_“Those people who develop the ability to continuously acquire new and better forms of knowledge that they can apply to their work and to their lives will be the movers and shakers in our society for the indefinite future.” -_ Brian Tracey**


A key tenant of the Authentic Growth process is being willing to teach yourself things that the majority of people won't learn. There is a definite correlation between the open-mindedness of a person and their ability to take in and use new information about their world. When you are open-minded, you are more able to view things objectively and take in the entire experience.


**When you allow yourself to explore new things, you give yourself the chance to grow from experiences that others will never have.**


I signed up for a 6-Day Tai Chi - Qi Gong seminar recently. Why did I do this? Because I found the subject very interesting and I thought it might help me balance my life in ways that I hadn't considered. I come from a business, programmer background and many people in this arena (especially the business half) don't ever take the time to consider their mental well-being. What I learned from this Qi Gong seminar was priceless. It opened the door for my thinking in a whole new direction. Along with this, I fully intend to apply the concepts I learned about inner balance, energy cultivation, and concentration to my work environment. In learning these concepts and applying them to my working environment, I am doing something that none of my colleagues (at least to my knowledge) are currently doing. This allows me an advantage in that I have enhanced my personal skill set. Who knows when or if I will use these techniques at work, but I can safely say that I now have another tool I can apply to new situations at work and in life.


**Most people around you stopped learning after high school or college. Be different: allow yourself to never stop learning.**


If you take the time to teach yourself something new each week, to study something that has always fascinated you, or to prepare yourself for the road ahead in life- you will put yourself years head of other people. I love to talk about the Compound Effect on Authentic Growth (see The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy) because applying these concepts over time can put you head and shoulders ahead of the general population. The goal in living an Authentic Growth lifestyle is to take responsibility for your life, your thoughts, your habits, your health, and anything else that is normally left for fate to decide. As you allow yourself to continue learning _whatever_ it is you want to learn, you expand your possibilities in life.


**As you learn new things, your life begins to change. Things you never thought existed suddenly become reality and you start developing a refined taste.**


When you open up yourself to learning new things, you start developing a truly unique sense of self. Once you've explored 10-15 new subject areas, hobbies or ideas, you really start to become a unique person. You may still participate in the daily new stories, latest technology, and everything of that nature, but you differentiate yourself by exploring things that many people don't explore. A great example of this is alternative/mental wellness techniques like EFT or the Z Point Process. I have always been fascinated with these techniques so I allow myself to read books that expand my toolset in this arena. These emotional wellness tools have without a doubt changed the course of my life and because of this I have amassed a wealth of knowledge in how to develop a clearer, more effective thinking process. Not only this- but the ideas I've studied make for great conversation.


**When you explore things that people haven't heard about, especially if these topics have made a big impact on your life, people are generally very interested in learning more.**


I have helped many people by sharing the wisdom I've gathered, like I do on AuthenticGrowth.com, with them face-to-face. The more interesting, useful, health and life improving subjects you learn, the more you have to share. Nowadays I feel I always have something I can relate to with the people around me because of all of the wide variety of topics I've allowed myself to explore. Whether you learn about body building, psychology, spirituality, engineering, mechanics, etc each skill you add to your mind opens one more gate for you to meet and converse with people in that area. Not to mention all the personal benefits you gain from learning these different topics!


**It is a lot easier to become proficient in a new subject than most people think. Teaching yourself something is one of life's most rewarding experiences.**


I'd be comfortable saying you can become pretty well-versed in most subjects if you read 4-5 of the best books in that area. I'm not saying you're going to be able to teach yourself how to be a doctor just by reading 4-5 books, but I am saying you can learn a whole lot about physiology and anatomy if you read 4-5 great books on those topics. Once you finish learning one subject, you can always decide to pursue that area more or move on to the next great idea. A while back I read one book about handwriting analysis. After reading that one book, I actually became really interested in learning more about it. Through the process of reading 4-5 books on the subject, I actually completely changed the way I write from plain printing to a more refined cursive script. Has this benefited me at all? Who knows! I do know that I was happy discovering and learning about the topic, and in the process I learned a great deal about handwriting in general.


**Your brain is not limited in the depth of what it can store. Each subject you learn adds on to the others and expands your mental capacity.**


Sure, you won't remember _everything_ you read, but you would be astonished at how much the brain can hold. Over the last three years I have read around 350 books, and if you ask me about any one of them I can comfortably talk about the best parts. I used to worry about whether reading so much was all in vein because I would forget it, but this simply hasn't happened. The more you read, the more your brain makes room for the things you read. Go out now and grab a book that interests you. As you learn, your competitive advantage in the world grows. Overtime, this Authentic Growth is invaluable.
