_**“Nothing compares to the simple pleasure of a bike ride.” - John F. Kennedy**_


Yes. I've done it. I've replaced my car for 95% of my commutes with a bike. When I moved within 8 miles of my work I knew I should give riding a bike to work a try. I always worried about the regular thoughts of "what if I get too hot while I'm pedaling and start to sweat" and also "what if I get tired or I don't feel like making it back home." The solution was simple once I started browsing Rad Power Bike's website and saw they had announced the [RadCity](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike?variant=27902381121) commuter bike. This bike can easily hit 20 miles an hour and includes an integrated handlebar throttle (along with 5-level pedal assist) so if you don't want to - you don't have to pedal while you're riding it.





### **The [RadCity](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike) is packed with features that bikes several thousand dollars or more have.**




Before I bought my RadCity, I had really only owned a few mountain bikes over my lifetime. I wasn't really aware of just how much the team at Rad Power Bikes had managed to pack into this low cost electric bike until I started noticing the features myself. For one thing - this commuter bike has a rear rack built into the bike frame and comes with fenders for the front and back wheels. I hadn't noticed this this, but when you're riding a regular pedal bike and you pass through puddles- the water from those puddles ends up shooting back on you from the wheel. Not with the RadCity - it's full fenders keep your body completely dry even when you pass through puddles. The Rear Rack is perfect for a small [bike trunk](http://amzn.to/2oqgZQF) and also supports pannier cargo bags which I happened to also purchase from their website.





### **The [RadCity's](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike?variant=27902381121) engine is smooth, quiet, and responsive.**


When I was first thinking about buying an electric bike, I was concerned that the motor would be loud enough to be noticeable by people on the street. That worry was erased instantly the first time I road my RadCity. It's so quiet that at first you won't really even notice it. I was just humming along, much faster than a regular bike - without even pedaling. I was pleasantly surprised by this because I really wanted to make sure I wasn't riding around on a bike that made noise. Even at a pedal-assist level of 5 (the highest setting), it was still much quieter than I was expecting. If loudness factor is a concern for you - rest assured you will be happy with this bike. 


### **It's much faster than a regular bike - beat out traffic while it looks like you're just pedaling.**




RadPoweredBikes tout's that the RadCity can hit speeds up to 20 MPH on throttle alone. I've personally been able to hit maybe 23 - 25 MPH on flat road whilst pedaling with pedal assist on. If you're going downhill and pedaling, the max I've hit on this thing is a breezy 30 MPH. To make a long story short - this bike is pretty fast. If you're familiar with your speed on a regular bike, the RadCity bike will easily double or possibly even triple that speed that you're used to on a regular bike. I got so used to the speed and ease of riding my [RadCity](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike), that when I hopped on a regular bike to get a little more exercise recently I had forgotten just how _slow_ a regular bike is compared to my RadCity bike.





### **Maintenance is cheap and easy - especially compared to your car.**




In the US, the IRS pegs the cost per mile of driving a car at around [53.5 cents a mile](https://www.irs.gov/uac/2017-standard-mileage-rates-for-business-and-medical-and-moving-announced). That accounts for things like gas, depreciation on the car, and insurance. Most people have no idea the cost per mile is actually calculated this high, and I think we can all say the IRS is using a reliable formula for calculating something that gets deducted by the millions in combined US tax returns. Now take an electric bike in comparison. 




With this ebike - all you have to do is keep it charged, clean the chain every month or two, maybe change the break pads after a couple hundred miles and you're set. Hell if you're riding on a down slope - you can almost consider your movement at that time to be free as the wheels spin. I actually attempted to calculate how much it cost to charge the full RadCity battery, and at a rate of $.17 per Kilowatt Hour - it came down to something like 10 or 11 cents for 20-40 miles! You will not be able to beat that driving around a big hunk of steal for your two mile solo commute to the gym.





### **You can actually move without pedaling - Supplement with the throttle whenever you need it**




One of the best things about the RadCity bike is it's built in throttle. I use it often when I'm stopped at a stop sign and need to accelerate again. It takes the load off of you having to pedal heavy just to get moving again - and it makes riding your bike everywhere just that much easier. In fact - two months ago I actually fractured one of my toes practicing TaeKwonDo (I accidentally roundhouse kicked the edge of a door frame - doh!).




I figured I wouldn't be able to ride my bike to work for some time. I took a day or two off to recuperate, but then I found I was perfectly capable of continuing using my RadCity bike because I had the throttle on hand for if I had any issues pedaling. I was able to get to and from work - using a mixture of pedaling which was mostly done with the heels of my feet, and the throttle - with a fractured toe! I wouldn't recommend doing that to everyone, but when you're hardcore sometimes there's no stopping you from getting where you want to go.





### **Bonus: Surprise On-Lookers By Moving From A Standstill Without Pedaling**




This was something funny that came up from riding my electric bike as a habit. When I'm waiting to cross a crosswalks - I can come to an almost complete standstill and balance myself using slight twists of the throttle. Once I'm ready to move I accelerate with a twist of the handle bar and off I go - no pedals needed. I've seen numerous onlookers stare in awe as I go from 0 mph to 5-20 mph without even pedaling! The look is priceless and while this fact alone shouldn't influence you to check out Rad Powered Bikes, it is an enjoyable side effect of owning a cool electric bike :).
